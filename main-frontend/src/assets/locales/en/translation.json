	"description": "Description",
	"description_bingo_37": "<p>Bingo 37 is a dynamic game with simple rules and high odds. Each round, the lottery drum throws out a random number from 1 to 37 inclusive. The task is to guess the number of the drop-down ball. Here is a dynamic table and a unique opportunity to create various combinations of bets, ranging from the simplest - on a single number, to complex combinations on lines, ranges of numbers and adjacent cells.</p>",
	"rules": "Rules of the game",
	"rules_bingo_37": "<p>Each round takes place in two stages: accepting bets and drawing. Each stage lasts an average of about 40 seconds. While accepting bets, you can put chips on the table. Bingo 37 uses chips of the following denominations:<ul><li>1</li><li>2</li><li>5</li><li>10</li><li>20</li></ul>Each chip can be placed both on one cell and on the intersection of cells (by clicking on the separating line), special fields with ranges are also available (for example, 1-12 or “Line 1”). <br />The more specific the forecast, the bigger the win. The following coefficients are used in the game:<ul><li>Number - x36;</li><li>Pair - x18;</li><li>Square or horizontal of one group of 12 numbers - x9;</li><li>Dozen - x3;</li><li>Large/small - x2.</li></ul>After the end of the betting stage, the drawing begins: the lottery drum goes live, which throws out a random ball with a number. </p>",
	
	
	"description_bingo_x": "<p>Bingo X is an exciting game with the familiar roulette table and similar rules. But there is a slight difference - there is no Zero here, the numbers start from 1 and end with 37. The live lottery drum throws one ball every round, the amount of winnings depends on the accuracy of the bet - and for this we have prepared many opportunities: bet not only on a specific number, but and any intersections of cells, pay attention to the ability to put on a color (some of the cells are red, some are white).</p>",
	"rules_bingo_x": "<p>Each round consists of two stages: accepting bets and drawing a ball. Stages last an average of about 40 seconds. While accepting bets, you can interact with the table by placing chips on it. Bingo X uses chips of the following denominations:<ul><li>1</li><li>2</li><li>5</li><li>10</li><li>20</li></ul>You have complete freedom - you can bet chips both on the same number and on the intersection of any numbers adjacent to each other. There are also special fields - lines, dozens (1-12, 13-24, 25-36), even/odd, large/small (1-18, 19-36) and colors (as you may have noticed, some of the cells on the table are colored in red, some in white). <br />The more accurate your forecast is, the bigger the winnings will be. The following odds are used in the game:<ul><li>Number - x36</li><li>Pair - x18;</li><li>Three - x12;</li><li>Square or horizontal of one group of 12 numbers - x9;</li><li>Dozen - x3;</li><li>Large/small - x2.</li></ul>After the end of the betting stage, the draw begins: the lottery drum goes live , which pops a random ball with a number.</p>",
